# United States Renal Data System (USRDS)

USRDS (United States Renal Data System) is a national registry and research database that collects comprehensive information on patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. The Standard Analysis Files (SAF) provide longitudinal, patient-level clinical, transplant, and claims data under a restricted data use agreement.

USRDS SAF serves as the foundational clinical data source for the exposome–transplant pipeline.

It provides:

- Kidney transplant recipient information
- Time-varying residency  
- Dialysis history  
- Donor and recipient characteristics  
- Medicare claims  
- Mortality and graft failure outcomes  

USRDS functions as the **anchor dataset** around which all exposure assignment, cohort construction, and modeling procedures are built. All downstream pipeline stages depend on identifiers and timestamps defined in USRDS.
